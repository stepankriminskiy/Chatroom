# Note
This is a personal recreation of a previous project that was developed in C for CSE 489 - Modern Networking Concepts

# Chatroom
A chatroom that utilizes python that runs a server that allows users to connect to and chat with each other. The server.py file runs the server, in this upload locally on the machine, and the client.py connects to the server. The user is prompted for their name that is visible to all other clients when they chat. This project utilized sockets to allow for connection and transfer of messages to happen and threading for multiple clients and to have clients both wait and send out messages to the server. The client and server folders have the project converted to an exe, allowing the files to be run without requiring python on the machine.
