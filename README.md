# Chatroom
A chatroom that utilizes python run on a server that allows users to connect to and chat with each other. The server.py file runs the server, in this upload locally on the machine, and the client.py connects to the server. The user is prompted for their name that is visible to all other clients when they chat. This project utilized sockets to allow for connection and transfer of messages to happen and threading for multiple clients and to have clients both wait and send out messages to the server.
